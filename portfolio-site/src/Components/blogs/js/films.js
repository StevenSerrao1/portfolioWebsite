        why: '"Mulholland Drive" excels due to its intricate narrative structure and David Lynch’s unique direction. The film starts as a seemingly straightforward mystery with Betty Elms (Naomi Watts) discovering an amnesiac woman (Laura Harring), but it gradually descends into a surreal exploration of identity and ambition. Key scenes like the Club Silencio performance and the enigmatic blue box blur the boundaries between reality and illusion, challenging viewers to piece together its fragmented story. Naomi Watts\' performance, shifting from naive optimism to harrowing despair, anchors the film\'s emotional intensity. Lynch’s masterful use of sound design and visual symbolism creates an unsettling, dreamlike atmosphere, making "Mulholland Drive" a standout in psychological thrillers.',
