                <h2>Me, in a nutshell</h2>
                <p id="about-me-body">Hey, I'm Steven, a 24-year-old tech enthusiast from South Africa, currently focused on mastering .NET development. My primary aim? Securing a challenging back-end or full-stack role in either Pretoria or Cape Town, where I can apply my skills and contribute to innovative projects.<br /><br />Beyond work, I find fulfillment in various hobbies and interests. I enjoy exploring diverse forms of entertainment, from thought-provoking films like Inception to immersive TV series like Breaking Bad. Musically, I appreciate a range of genres, including classic rock and indie favorites, without overlooking the timeless contributions of legends like The Beatles.<br /><br />In my downtime, I'm a basketball fan and draw inspiration from athletes like Kobe Bryant for their dedication and perseverance. Additionally, gaming has been a longstanding passion of mine, not just for leisure but also for the insights it provides into problem-solving and creativity, which I apply to my programming endeavors.<br /><br />Ultimately, my professional aspirations are at the forefront of my journey, driving me to continuously learn and grow in the tech industry.</p>
