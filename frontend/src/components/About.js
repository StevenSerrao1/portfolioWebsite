                <h2>Me, in a nutshell</h2>
                <p id="about-me-body">Hey! I'm Steven, a 24 year-old South-African software developer with a knack for .NET and Node.js. 
                I'm on the hunt for a dynamic back-end or full-stack role in either Gauteng (Pretoria/JHB) or the Western Cape, where I can dive into groundbreaking projects that will help to put SA on the map! <br /><br />
                Outside of work, I'm a problem-solver at heart. Complex challenges get my brain buzzing, and I love exploring new tech and building impactful software. 
                Whether it's personal projects or just keeping myself updated, I'm constantly learning and pushing myself 
                to be better. <br /><br />  When I need to unwind, I turn to thought-provoking entertainment. Films like Inception make me think, and shows like Breaking Bad 
                keep me glued to the screen. Basketball is another passion (Kobe Bryant, anyone?). My music taste is all over the place, from classic rock like Led Zeppelin, to indie gems like RKS, 
                with a healthy dose of timeless legends like The Beatles thrown in. Gaming has also been a big part of my life, teaching me valuable problem-solving 
                skills and creativity that translate well to coding. <br /><br />  Ultimately, my tech aspirations fuel my drive to learn, innovate, and make a real 
                difference. <br /> I want to leave my mark on the ever-evolving world of technology.</p>
