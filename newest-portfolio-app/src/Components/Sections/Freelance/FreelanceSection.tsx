        <p>
            Need a reliable developer to build something solid, scalable, and maintainable? I work with startups, solo founders, and small teams to build modern web applications and backend systems that actually hold up under pressure. Whether you're launching an MVP, upgrading legacy code, or need a clean API to plug into your frontend—I've got you covered.
        </p>
        <p>
            My freelance focus is on backend-heavy systems built with ASP.NET Core and Entity Framework, deployed in cloud environments like Azure or Render. I also bring front-end capability to the table with React and Blazor—because integration shouldn't be a damn nightmare.
        </p>
        <p>
            Based in South Africa and available for remote work worldwide, I offer affordable, high-quality solutions with a strong technical foundation and zero fluff.
